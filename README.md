# Simple Snake game in Rust

The best way to learn something is to throw yourself in at the deep end and give it a go.  This is my first attempt at writing something in rust, and I thought I would share it here for comment.

My aim for the game is to make it as easy to read as possile, whilst making use of standard Rust design patterns at all times.  At time of first checking, this is not the case just yet, but this is one of my primary goals for this code.

Please feel free to comment on any aspect of how this project has been implemented.

## TODO
- [ ] Game state
  - [ ] UI overlay (score, game over, 'press key to start')
  - [ ] Reset game after 'game over'
  - [ ] High scores
- [ ] Idiomatic Rust
  - [ ] is line1.iter().chain(line2...) better?
  - [ ] lots more, I'm sure!
